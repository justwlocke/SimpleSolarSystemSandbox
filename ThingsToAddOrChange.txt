Try to resolve initial buggy movement by...

1. A boolean in fixed update that is set to true to begin simulating after a second
2. Set timeScale to 0 and use WaitForRealTime to wait for a second, to set it to 1.
3. Set timeScale to 0 and wait for player input to start simulating.    -- Done, waits for player input


Things To Add
1. When spawning planet, a line from the mouse to the spawned-but-not-released planet.  -- Done
2. An estimated trajectory of the spawned-but-not-released planet in the direction of the force that will be applied
3. Some way of editing details of a celestial body that will be spawned on next right click
	3a. Perhaps another panel of UI in the top right that has a selection of different sizes of planets? 
		3b. Which on mouse hover will reveal details of said planet
4. Spawn a copy of an established planet.   -- Done
5. Highlight (Change color) of selected planets trail -- Done
6. Give spawned bodies their own detail window (With unknown values)


Things To Change
1. Have the length of a planets trail be affected by their current velocity/size/mass  -- Done
2. Re-anchor the Facts Sheet so that it gets a bit bigger
3. Destroy things that get sucked into the middle of the sun
4. Re-anchor the player start panel to be a bit smaller  -- Done


Things to Fix
1. The clamping on the Camera bounds   - Fixed
2. Clicking on the Time Slider should not deselect the planet -- Done
3. Fix the Camera moving super fast when the timeScale is super fast
